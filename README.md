# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the app

In order to run the app, following commands needs to be executed

```
npm install
npm run start
```

In addition, this app include tests. To run them, execute the command:

```
npm run test
```

## UX

I have proposed a different UX where the user can filter the cities by a text or by the selected ones.
In addition, I have added a button to clear the selection so the user can reset the selection by just clicking on one button instead of uncheck all the preferred cities.
I have not added a "select all" button because I don't think it applies to these scenario. I don't think someone prefers to live in all the cities in a country or state.

Something that could be also included is the ability to display the cities grouped by country or state. Whit a large list of cities like these, it could be a good idea to display them grouped. In addition, it could help the user to look for a city in a state or country if he doesn't rememeber the exact city name.
